# Hi.. Hoi... Hello... Aloha
> <span style="color:blue"> Thank you for visiting my page. I'm Reuben an aspiring software developer. My passion for trading has led me to my automated trading, which is why initially I learnt python with the sole purpose of writing algorithms for trading but that has since become a rabbit hole i have gladly ventured down. My love for knowledge has left me wanting more and in that quest i have decided to enroll to do my bachelors in IT with focus on software development ,data science,machine learning and neural networks. While in my spare time i have dedicated to learning javascript and c++. </span>

### Life is a lesson
>Blockchain and trading inspired me to learn programming, its been a snowball ever since... one can never know enough
After learning the basics of [**python**](https://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/dutchindex.xhtml), i delved into the basics of **MYSQL**, **HTML**,**CSS**
While building on [AUTOBOT](https://github.com/ReubenHawley/Autobot) i used the *Pandas* to handle dataframe and data manipulation, *concurrency* to thread and multiprocess parts of my code ,*numpy* to work with arrays,*ccxt* to obtain data and perform execution of trades via an *API*, i then used *sklearn* to build linear regression models. I hosted this bot on a server on an AWS EC2 instance and learned how to ssh into servers.

>For kicks i followed a tutorial on [penetration testing](https://github.com/ReubenHawley/Penetration_testing). I learned how to structure programs in order to respond to them via commandline. I learned a lot about networking and how to gain access via a backdoor.

*My learning roadmap:*
- Vanilla [*javascript*](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)
- *REACT*
- *C++*

### Lets take a walk
>I'm very keen on collaborating with other developers especially in the fields of *data science*, *machine learning*, *statistics* and *probability*
---
### If you have a moment...
>I would love to learn more about javascript and could use some help getting started, all tips and advice welcome, especially when it comes to asynchronous programming

### Wanna hook up?
> Enough about me... I'd like to hear from you. give me a shout out on reubenhawley@gmail.com or hit me up on twitter
