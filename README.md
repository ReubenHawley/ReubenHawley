# Hi.. Hoi... Hello... Aloha
> thank you for visiting my page. I'm Reuben an aspiring software developer. My passion for trading has led me to my automated trading, which is why initially I learnt python with the sole purpose of writing algorithms for trading but that has since become a rabbit hole i have gladly ventured down. My love for knowledge has left me wanting more and in that quest i have decided to enroll to do my bachelors in IT with focus on software development ,data science,machine learning and neural networks. While in my spare time i have dedicated to learning javascript and c++.

### Life is a lesson
>Blockchain and trading inspired me to learn programming, its been a snowball ever since... one can never know enough
After learning the basics of **python**, i delved into **MYSQL**, **HTML**,**CSS**
which led me down the rabbit hole to learn the *Pandas*, *concurrency* , *numpy*,*ccxt*,*sklearn*,*bootstrap4*.
Currently i'm learning *javascript* to handle the client side, followed by *REACT* to be able to build mobile and web applications

### Lets take a walk
>I'm very keen on collaborating with other developers especially in the fields of *data science*, *machine learning*, *statistics* and *probability*
